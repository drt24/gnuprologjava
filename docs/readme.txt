GNU Prolog for Java 0.2.6
-------------------------

This is a conforming implementation of ISO Prolog standard part 
1 in Java. Any outstanding bugs are listed in NEWS.txt and on the
bugtracker (https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=gnuprologjava).
 
This package is a library which is designed to be embedded into
Java applications which need Prolog to solve some tasks. The
interpreter is intended for applications where Prolog performs
combinatory search and Java does the rest. The library allows
easy communication between Java and Prolog.
The library is released under LGPL terms. 

There is a javadoc api and a texinfo manual (compiled to info
and html) which you should find distributed with this code or
installed in standard locations.

How can you contribute: 

 1.Write more code. If you wish to do this email
    info-gnuprologjava@gnu.org or look on the bugtracker for
    bugs or features you wish to squash/implement. I can give
    you a list of current tasks from which you can select one
    which interests you. 
 2.Send us a copy of ISO Standard of Prolog. Now I have
    incomplete copy of some sections: the corrected sections
    7 and 8 from part 1, the whole (I hope) of part 2 the DCGs
    draft as of 2010-04-0` and the 2006 extensions to part 1 
    (updated in 2009).
