<H1>GNU Prolog for Java 0.1.0</H1>

<P>This is an <I>almost</I> conforming implementation of ISO Prolog standard in 
Java. It implements almost all required predicates, but there are some minor 
problems which do not allow me to call it conforming. To check current status of 
conformance you can try to run tests yourself. 
<P>This package were never indended to be used as standalone system, it is a 
library which is designed to embeddable into Java applications which need Prolog 
to solve some tasks. The interpreter intended for applications where Prolog 
performs combinatory search and Java do rest. The library allows easy 
communication between Java and Prolog. The library is released under <A 
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">LGPL</A> terms. 
<P>It was build with JDK 1.2 from start and I do not plan to support 1.1.x 
platform, some features of JDK 1.2 required i.e: 
<UL>
  <LI>Weak references (planned) 
  <LI>Improved serialization 
  <LI>Collection Framework </LI></UL>It does not have an IDE and I don't plan to 
create one. If you wish you can undertake it as separate project. But some sort 
of box GUI debugger is planned. 
<P>I plan to introduce major changes to core as result of several related 
optimizations. So if you are writing some predicates in Java, be prepared to 
change your code. 
<P>But this code will remain here for a while, and I'll fix minor bugs.
